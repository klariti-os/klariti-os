## [Manifesto] : Project anti zuckerberg


> We believe that technology should serve people, not exploit them. We reject addictive designs and data commodification. We hence prioritize transparency, privacy, and digital well-being. Our tools empower users to reclaim their time, align technology with human values, and live balanced, productive lives.


### We are developing a system to address the growing issue of digital addiction and its associated impacts. This initiative includes creating a web application, a Chrome extension, and a mobile app. The project will involve conducting research on brain activity linked to interactions with specific digital platforms, such as Instagram. Insights from this research will guide the design of effective solutions to counteract highly addictive algorithms.
